Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of how to visualize the `HashMap` data structure, including its key components and operations. I’ll provide diagrams for the hash table structure, collision handling, and resizing process.

### 1. **Hash Table Structure**

This diagram represents a hash table with an array of buckets, where each bucket can hold a key-value pair.

**Hash Table with Key-Value Pairs:**

```
+----+-------------+
| 0  | ("key1", 10) |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | ("key2", 20) |
+----+-------------+
| 2  | ("key3", 30) |
+----+-------------+
| 3  | Empty        |
+----+-------------+
| 4  | Empty        |
+----+-------------+
```

### 2. **Collision Handling**

When a collision occurs, we use linear probing to find the next available slot. 

**Collision Handling Example:**

- Suppose the hash of `"key4"` collides with `"key2"`, which is at index 1.

1. **Initial State:**
   ```
   +----+-------------+
   | 0  | ("key1", 10) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 1  | ("key2", 20) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 2  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   ```

2. **Collision and Linear Probing:**
   - The initial hash of `"key4"` maps to index 1, which is occupied by `"key2"`.
   - We check the next index (2) which is empty.

3. **After Collision Handling:**
   ```
   +----+-------------+
   | 0  | ("key1", 10) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 1  | ("key2", 20) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 2  | ("key4", 40) |
   +----+-------------+
   ```

### 3. **Resizing**

When the load factor exceeds a threshold, the hash table is resized (typically doubled) and all existing entries are rehashed.

**Initial State (Before Resizing):**
```
+----+-------------+
| 0  | ("key1", 10) |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | ("key2", 20) |
+----+-------------+
| 2  | Empty        |
+----+-------------+
| 3  | Empty        |
+----+-------------+
```

**After Resizing to New Size (e.g., size doubled to 6):**

1. **Copy Entries:**
   ```
   +----+-------------+
   | 0  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 1  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 2  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 3  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 4  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 5  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   ```

2. **Rehash and Add Existing Entries:**

   - `"key1"` hashes to index 0.
   - `"key2"` hashes to index 2.

3. **Final State:**
   ```
   +----+-------------+
   | 0  | ("key1", 10) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 1  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 2  | ("key2", 20) |
   +----+-------------+
   | 3  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 4  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   | 5  | Empty        |
   +----+-------------+
   ```

### Summary of Key Operations

- **Hashing:** Converts a key into an index in the array.
- **Collision Handling:** Uses linear probing to resolve collisions.
- **Resizing:** Doubles the size of the hash table and rehashes all entries.

These diagrams and explanations should help visualize how the `HashMap` structure and operations work. If you need more details or additional diagrams, feel free to ask!
