### Understanding the Tree Height

The height of a binary tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf. In other words, it's the number of nodes in the longest path from the root down to the farthest leaf node, minus one (because height is usually considered the number of edges, not nodes).

### Recursive Calculation

The `internalHeight` function calculates the height of a tree rooted at a given node by:
1. **Recursively calculating the height of the left subtree**.
2. **Recursively calculating the height of the right subtree**.
3. **Taking the maximum of these two heights**.
4. **Adding 1 to account for the current node itself**.

Here's the code again for reference:

```cpp
int internalHeight(TreeNode<Tdata> *node) {
    if (node == nullptr)
        return 0;
    return 1 + max(internalHeight(node->Left), internalHeight(node->Right));
}
```

### Why Add 1?

The addition of 1 accounts for the current node in the height calculation. To understand this, let's consider a simple example:

#### Example

Imagine a tree with just a single node:

```
    1
```

- When `internalHeight` is called on this node:
  - It checks if the node is `nullptr`. It isn't.
  - It then calls `internalHeight` on both the left and right children, which are `nullptr`.
  - For both `nullptr` children, `internalHeight` returns 0.
  - The function takes the maximum of these two values (which is 0) and adds 1 for the current node.

So the height calculation is:

```
1 + max(0, 0) = 1
```

This `1` is added to represent the height contribution of the current node itself.

#### Larger Example

Consider the following tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

- For node 1:
  - It calls `internalHeight` on node 2:
    - Node 2 has no children, so `internalHeight` on both children returns 0.
    - Height for node 2 is `1 + max(0, 0) = 1`.
  - It calls `internalHeight` on node 3:
    - Node 3 has no children, so `internalHeight` on both children returns 0.
    - Height for node 3 is `1 + max(0, 0) = 1`.
  - Height for node 1 is `1 + max(1, 1) = 2`.

The `1` added at each step accounts for the current node's contribution to the height.

### General Rule

At each step of the recursion, the `internalHeight` function computes the height of the subtree rooted at the current node. By adding 1 to the maximum height of its subtrees, it correctly includes the current node's contribution to the total height of the tree.

- **Without adding 1**: You would only measure the height of the subtrees and ignore the current node, leading to an incorrect height.
- **By adding 1**: You ensure that each level of the tree is counted correctly, providing an accurate measure of the tree's height.
