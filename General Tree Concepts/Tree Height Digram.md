Certainly! Here is a visual representation of how the `internalHeight` function works, with nodes and their recursive calls, to help you understand how the height is calculated:

```plaintext
                    internalHeight(root)
                          |
             +------------+------------+
             |                         |
    internalHeight(Left)      internalHeight(Right)
             |                         |
   +---------+--------+       +--------+--------+
   |                  |       |                 |
internalHeight      internal internalHeight   internal
(node->Left)       Height    (node->Left)    Height
                   (node)                   (node)
                    = 0                     = 0

internalHeight(node)
= 1 + max(internalHeight(Left), internalHeight(Right))
= 1 + max(0, 0)
= 1
```

### Detailed Explanation
- Starting at the root, `internalHeight` is called with the root node.
- The function then calls itself recursively for the left and right children of the root.
- For leaf nodes (nodes with no children), the function returns 0.
- For each node, the function calculates the height by taking the maximum of the heights of its left and right children and adding 1 to account for the current node.

### Example with a Simple Tree
Here's an example tree for better visualization:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Node 4**:
   - `internalHeight(4)`: No children, returns `0 + 1 = 1`.
2. **Node 5**:
   - `internalHeight(5)`: No children, returns `0 + 1 = 1`.
3. **Node 2**:
   - `internalHeight(2)`: Left height = 1 (node 4), right height = 1 (node 5).
   - Returns `1 + max(1, 1) = 2`.
4. **Node 3**:
   - `internalHeight(3)`: No children, returns `0 + 1 = 1`.
5. **Root (Node 1)**:
   - `internalHeight(1)`: Left height = 2 (node 2), right height = 1 (node 3).
   - Returns `1 + max(2, 1) = 3`.

Here's a diagram of the process:

```plaintext
       internalHeight(1)
             |
    +--------+--------+
    |                 |
internalHeight(2) internalHeight(3)
    |                 |
+---+---+         +---+---+
|       |         |       |
int(4)  int(5)   int(3)   int(3)
= 1     = 1      = 1      = 1
```
