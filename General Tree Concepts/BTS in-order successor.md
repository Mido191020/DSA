Let's break down the `deleteNodeWithTwoChildren_helper()` function, focusing on the concept of the **successor** and how the deletion process works:

### What is an In-Order Successor?

In a **binary search tree (BST)**, the **in-order successor** of a node is the node with the **next larger value** in the tree, relative to the current node.

When deleting a node with **two children**, the in-order successor is often used to replace the node being deleted. This is because the in-order successor:
1. Is guaranteed to be greater than the current node (due to its position in the right subtree).
2. Is the smallest possible node in the right subtree.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Finding the Node to Delete**:
   ```cpp
   treeNode<tData>* cur = find(value);
   ```
   The `find(value)` function is called to locate the node in the tree that has the value `value`. This is the node we want to delete.

2. **Check if Node Exists**:
   ```cpp
   if (!cur) {
       cout << "The node was not found!" << endl;
       return;
   }
   ```
   If the node isn't found in the tree (i.e., `cur == nullptr`), the function returns an error message.

3. **Find the In-Order Successor**:
   ```cpp
   treeNode<tData>* successor = findMinNode(cur->right);
   ```
   Here, the function calls `findMinNode(cur->right)` to find the **in-order successor**. This function navigates to the **smallest node in the right subtree** of the current node (`cur`), which is the in-order successor.

   - **Why the right subtree?**: 
     In a BST, the left subtree contains smaller values, and the right subtree contains larger values. The in-order successor of a node will always be the **smallest node in the right subtree**. Hence, calling `findMinNode(cur->right)` gives us the next largest value in the tree.

4. **Extract the Successor’s Value**:
   ```cpp
   tData successorValue = successor->data;
   ```
   The successor node found in the previous step is a pointer to the smallest node in the right subtree. Here, the code extracts the value of that successor node into the variable `successorValue`.

5. **Replace the Current Node’s Value**:
   ```cpp
   cur->data = successorValue;
   ```
   Instead of deleting the current node directly, the code **replaces the current node’s value** with the value of the in-order successor. This preserves the binary search tree structure because the in-order successor is the next valid value in the tree.

6. **Delete the Successor Node**:
   ```cpp
   deleteNodeHasChild_helper(successorValue);
   ```
   After replacing the current node’s value with the successor's, the successor node needs to be removed from its original location. Since the in-order successor will always have **at most one child** (it’s the smallest in the right subtree, so it can't have a left child), we use the `deleteNodeHasChild_helper()` function to remove it safely.

### Why Use the Successor?

When deleting a node with two children:
- Directly removing the node would disrupt the BST property, because it's unclear which child to replace it with.
- The in-order successor provides a way to maintain the correct ordering of the tree. By replacing the node’s value with the successor’s value and then deleting the successor (which has at most one child), we maintain the tree's structure.

### Summary of the Process

1. **Find the node** to delete.
2. **Locate the in-order successor**, which is the smallest node in the right subtree.
3. **Replace the current node's value** with the successor's value.
4. **Delete the successor**, which has at most one child, using a simplified deletion process.

This approach preserves the integrity of the BST while efficiently handling the case of a node with two children.
