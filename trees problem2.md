For a beginner like you, focusing on patterns in tree problems can help you build a strong foundation. Let's break down tree problems into common patterns. Each pattern will involve a certain type of problem:

### 1. **Basic Traversals**
   - **Problems**: These help you understand how to move through trees.
     - Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
     - Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
     - Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
   - **Key Concepts**: Recursive and iterative traversal, DFS (Depth-First Search), understanding tree structure.

### 2. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**
   - **Problems**:
     - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
     - Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
     - Binary Tree Right Side View
   - **Key Concepts**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) using a queue, understanding tree levels.

### 3. **Tree Properties**
   - **Problems**: Understanding height, depth, and structural properties of trees.
     - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
     - Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
     - Diameter of Binary Tree
     - Symmetric Tree
   - **Key Concepts**: Recursive height calculation, checking symmetry, understanding diameter (longest path between two nodes).

### 4. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties**
   - **Problems**: Focus on properties of binary search trees.
     - Validate Binary Search Tree
     - Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST
     - Kth Smallest Element in a BST
   - **Key Concepts**: Leveraging the BST property (left < root < right), recursive/iterative search.

### 5. **Tree Modifications**
   - **Problems**: Changing or modifying the tree structure.
     - Invert Binary Tree
     - Merge Two Binary Trees
     - Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
   - **Key Concepts**: Modifying tree nodes, converting tree structure.

### 6. **Path Problems**
   - **Problems**: Finding paths or sums along paths.
     - Path Sum
     - Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
     - Path Sum II
     - Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
   - **Key Concepts**: DFS for pathfinding, understanding cumulative sums.

### 7. **Tree Construction**
   - **Problems**: Build trees from traversals or other inputs.
     - Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Preorder Traversal
     - Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
   - **Key Concepts**: Understanding how to reconstruct trees based on traversal information.

### Learning from Problems
1. **If you can't solve a problem**:
   - Break it down into smaller parts.
   - Understand the pattern (e.g., traversal, path sum).
   - Watch the solution video if needed, but focus on understanding the logic behind each step.

2. **If you understand it partially**:
   - Try to implement the problem again on your own after the video.
   - Solve variations of the same problem.
   - Try to explain the solution to yourself or someone else in simple terms.

3. **After solving**:
   - Reflect on the pattern: What type of problem was it? (Traversal, pathfinding, etc.)
   - Identify where you got stuck and why.
   - Write down the approach in your own words or pseudocode for future reference.

This structured approach will help you learn progressively and solidify your understanding of tree-related problems.
